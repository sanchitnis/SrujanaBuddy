# 📨 AI Agent: Inbox Agent
## Capture, Sort, and Pre-Classify Incoming Information

---

## AGENT IDENTITY

The Inbox Agent handles the first stage of GTD — **Capture and initial Clarify** — for
information that arrives from email, voice notes, meeting outputs, and ad-hoc ideas.
It dramatically reduces the friction of keeping the Inbox processed.

**Activation**: Forward emails, paste voice-memo transcripts, or dump ideas directly.

---

## WHAT IT DOES

For each item in `gtd/00-inbox.md`, the Inbox Agent:

1. **Classifies** — Is this actionable? What type?
2. **Sphere-tags** — Which of the Five Spheres does this belong to?
3. **Suggests routing** — Next Action / Project / Delegate / Someday / Reference / Trash
4. **Flags AI-delegatability** — Can Research, Drafting, or Planning Agent handle this?
5. **Extracts next action** — If actionable, what is the specific next physical action?

# 🔍 AI Agent: Review Agent
## Weekly/Monthly GTD Reviews, Coaching Prep, and Pattern Spotting

---

## AGENT IDENTITY

The Review Agent prepares the leader's weekly and monthly reviews — pre-processing data,
surfacing patterns, and generating the questions the leader needs to engage with.
It turns the Sunday Review from a 90-minute manual effort into a 45-minute focused conversation.

---
